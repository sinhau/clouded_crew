            From our founder Natureboy, I started this project because in my
            childhood I lived in my head a lot. During class I always found
            myself daydreaming about something - my head was always in the
            clouds. I wanted to share that feeling of allowing yourself to be
            truly curious again back into the world and support the next
            generation of creatives. To allow people to dream, wander, and
            believe - that is my mission. I hope that people who see our
            creations will appreciate all the hard work and hundreds of hours we
            put into each project and cant wait to share it for the world to
            see.
