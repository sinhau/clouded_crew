We are proud to say that we are doing exactly that, and are now ready to share our first project Clouded Crew. We believe in creativity, dreams, and wandering. We encourage you all to let your curiosity guide you and to allow yourself to fully immerse in the creative process."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
